"RestoraniBG" is an app which idea is to unite restaurants in the city of Belgrade, where you're able to order food, apply for a job, etc.

You can not add items to cart, like a restaurant, or apply to a job until you log in to the system.
You can register as a 'normal' user or as a restaurant. 

Once when you are registered as a user you can add items to cart, proceed to checkout page, apply for a job, and like a restaurant you like. And you can view your orders, applied jobs, liked restaurants.

On the other hand, when you are registered as restaurant you're able to manage your products, post a job, add menu items, etc. Also, you can see applicants on your job vacancies, all your orders, etc.

The administrator of the system is able to manage all crucial elements on the app(links, categories).
